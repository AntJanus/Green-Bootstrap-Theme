Green Bootstrap Theme
======================

For the purposes of an article I wrote, I created a bootstrap theme.

It's currently running on BS2.1.0 If you want to upgrade, it's pretty easy. Just match up the bootstrap.less and variables.less files to the new version. Nothing else was changed :)

Resources Used
===============

* [BootTheme](http://boottheme.com) - used to generate theme. Also, used for the index file preview
* [ColourLovers](http://colourlovers.com)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
* [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/)
